# ML-AI_Certificate_Imperial_Project
Project submitted for the completion of the ML&amp;AI Certificate 
Model predicts whether a customer will accept or reject a coupon offered. Since we can not offer coupon to everyone, we would be targeting those candidates who are most likely to accept the coupon based on personal and demographic attributes. We are using model precision as a measure to evaluate model performance. With the gradient based tree model we have achieved 76% precision which means for every 100 coupons offered 76 will accept it.
